# Enviro-Setup-Packs
 My paper experimental environment installation package. This repository contains scripts and configurations used to set up the computational environment for my research experiments.

> Tested and confirmed: WSL on Windows can also set up the environment using the following installation steps.
> If you have already installed the NVIDIA driver in Windows, you can first test it with the command "nvidia-smi". If the function is normal, you do not need to reinstall the NVIDIA driver
